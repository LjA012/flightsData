# flightsData

Welcome to my inspection and analysis of flights. This is in response to the third project being assigned, where we were tasked with completeing a regression on some type of data. 

### Data
The data that was used was from Kaggle, surprise surprise. https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays
Data consisted of all US flights from the year 2015. After taking out outliers and only using the 10 busiest airports, my data set consisted of aroun 1.8 million flights.

### Code
You can follow my process and findings through the notebooks I have uploaded.

### Problems
Wait...problems?!  I thought I was able to do a linear regression on my data, but all of the assumtions were not met, so I had to use quantile regression.  Let me know if you have any questions!
